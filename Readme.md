This repository contains the material for the advanced macroeconomics course at Western University.<br/>
This is a second year PhD course focused on computational tools for quantitative Macroeconomics.<br/>
The course syllabus is located in the main folder.<br/>
The lecture handouts are located in the "Slides" folder.<br/>
Accompanying code is located in the "Julia_Code" folder and its subfolders. All code is in Julia and runs in version 1.5.1.<br/>
Problem sets and other assignments are located in the "Problem_Sets" folder.<br/>
